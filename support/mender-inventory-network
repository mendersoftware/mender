# Example script called by Mender agent to collect inventory data for a
# particular devce. The script needs to be located in $(datadir)/mender and its
# name shall start with `mender-inventory-` prefix. The script shall exit with
# non-0 status on errors. In this case the agent will discard any output the
# script may have produced.
#
# The script shall output inventory data in <key>=<value> format, one entry per
# line. Entries appearing multiple times will be joined in a list under the same
# key.
