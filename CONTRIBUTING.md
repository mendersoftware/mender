Contributing to Mender
======================

Thank you for showing interest in contributing to the Mender project.
Connecting with contributors and growing a community is very important to us.
We hope you will find what you need to get started on this page.

## Reporting security issues

If you come across any security issue, please bring it to our team's
attention as quickly as possible by sending an email to
[security@mender.io](mailto:security@mender.io).

Please do not disclose anything in public. Once an issue has been addressed we
will publish the fix and acknowledge your finding on our site if you so wish.


## Proposed tasks to get started

There is a `helpwanted` tag on some tasks in the Mender issue tracker
that have been identified as good candidates for initial contributors.

You can see them in the [Help Wanted saved filter](https://northerntech.atlassian.net/issues/?filter=10084).


## Providing pull requests

Pull requests are very welcome, and the maintainers of Mender work hard
to stay on top to review and hopefully merge your work.

If your work is significant, it can make sense to discuss the idea with the
maintainers and relevant project members upfront. Start a discussion on our [Mender Hub forum](https://hub.mender.io/c/general-discussions).

Using commit signoffs tags is mandatory for all commits; we also
encourage that each commit is small and cohesive. See the next sections for details.


### Programming style

#### Organization

The code is organized into shared and platform specific folders. The shared code
contains application logic which does not depend on platform specific code, as
well as C++ interface classes for code that does. All code that interacts with
the operating system, such as file access, network operations, timers, process
creation, etc, must happen through such as C++ interface.

The interfaces must be organized in a `src/common/<MODULE>/<MODULE>.hpp`
hierarchy. An example of a `<MODULE>` name is `json`, for doing JSON
parsing. The platform implementation must reside in `src/common/<MODULE>/platform/<PLATFORM>/*.cpp`
files. An example of a `<PLATFORM>` is `posix` or `boost`.

All the API must be namespaced inside the `<MODULE>` name. Avoid C macros if
possible, since they can't be namespaced.

#### Code style

Our code style follows [the Google C++ Style
Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html) with a few
exceptions. To run automatic code style formatting on files you modify, use our
[clang-format
template](https://github.com/mendersoftware/mendertesting/blob/master/.clang-format):

```bash
curl -L -O https://github.com/mendersoftware/mendertesting/raw/master/.clang-format
clang-format -i --style=file:.clang-format <MODIFIED_FILES>
```

Note that the template requires clang-format version 15 or higher.

##### C++ standard

All shared code must use C++ features from no later than the C++11 standard,
with a few exceptions:

* Platform code for POSIX platforms is allowed to use C++17 if necessary, but
  C++11 is preferred for consistency with the rest of the code.

* It is allowed (and encouraged) to use `std::make_unique` from C++14. We will
  have special arrangements in the code to import this from Boost on platforms
  where it's not available.

#### File names

Files must be named with `.cpp` and `.hpp` extensions. Only use `.h` if the
header holds C declarations.

##### Indentation

Indentation in Mender code uses 1 tab per level, no spaces. Function arguments
or initializers that are broken over multiple lines are indented one level. For
example:

```
MyClass::MyFunc(
	std::string long_argument1,
	std::string long_argument2,
	std::string long_argument3,
	std::string long_argument4) :
	member1(0),
	member2(0) {
	CallAnotherLongFunction(
		long_argument1,
		long_argument2,
		long_argument3,
		long_argument4);
}
```

##### Line length

Our line lengths are capped at 100 characters instead of 80, which is Google's
cap. When considering line lengths, each tab is considered 4 characters
wide. [The other guidelines for line
length](https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html#Line_Length) still
apply.

##### Namespaces

All the [rules about
namespaces](https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html#Namespaces) apply,
with two exceptions. All namespaces must be spelled out where they are used
except for:

* It is allowed to use `using namespace std` to import the `std` namespace.
* It is allowed to shorten long names using `namespace short_name = long_name`.


##### C headers

In general, C++ libraries and wrappers should be preferred over C
equivalents. However, it is permitted to include C headers if no good
alternative is available. This must only be done inside platform code.

If including headers from the Standard C Library, use this form:

```
#include <cstring>  // Good
#include <string.h> // Bad, should not be used in C++ code.
```

##### Code blocks

All code blocks occurring as part of `if` statements, `for` loops or `while`
loops, must be enclosed in curly brackets, even single line blocks.

##### Class access specifiers

Class access specifiers, `public`, `protected` and `private` must be indented at
the same level as their parent class, in other words at the same level as where
the `class` keyword appears. For example:

```
class MyClass {
public:
	MyClass();
}
```


### Sign your work

Mender is licensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0. To ensure open source
license compatibility, we need to keep track of the origin of all commits and
make sure they comply with the license. To do this, we follow the same procedure
as used by the Linux kernel, and ask every commit to be signed off.

The sign-off is a simple line at the end of the explanation for the patch, which
certifies that you wrote it or otherwise have the right to pass it on as an
open-source commit.  The rules are pretty simple: if you can certify the below
(from [developercertificate.org](http://developercertificate.org/)):


```
Developer Certificate of Origin
Version 1.1

Copyright (C) 2004, 2006 The Linux Foundation and its contributors.
660 York Street, Suite 102,
San Francisco, CA 94110 USA

Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this
license document, but changing it is not allowed.

Developer's Certificate of Origin 1.1

By making a contribution to this project, I certify that:

(a) The contribution was created in whole or in part by me and I
    have the right to submit it under the open source license
    indicated in the file; or

(b) The contribution is based upon previous work that, to the best
    of my knowledge, is covered under an appropriate open source
    license and I have the right under that license to submit that
    work with modifications, whether created in whole or in part
    by me, under the same open source license (unless I am
    permitted to submit under a different license), as indicated
    in the file; or

(c) The contribution was provided directly to me by some other
    person who certified (a), (b) or (c) and I have not modified
    it.

(d) I understand and agree that this project and the contribution
    are public and that a record of the contribution (including all
    personal information I submit with it, including my sign-off) is
    maintained indefinitely and may be redistributed consistent with
    this project or the open source license(s) involved.
```

Then you just add a line to every git commit message:

    Signed-off-by: Random J Developer <random@developer.example.org>

Use your real name (sorry, no pseudonyms or anonymous contributions).

If you set your `user.name` and `user.email` git configs, you can sign your
commit automatically with `git commit -s`.


### Structuring your commits

More often than not, your pull request will come as a set of commits, not just
a single one. This is especially recommended in case of larger changesets.

In that case, please make sure that each commit constitutes a cohesive, logical
whole, e.g.  modifies a given package, function, or application layer. There are many ways
to conceptually divide your changeset, depending on its size and content - this is up to you.
It's just important that unrelated changes are not mixed up together in unrelated commits.

This is to ensure that:
* your PR is easy to browse and review
* git log is easier to digest

At the Mender project we are adhering to a slightly modified version of
[conventional
commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/#specification). The full
specification of which can be found
[here](https://github.com/mendersoftware/mendertesting/blob/master/commitlint/grammar.md).

tldr; in general your contribution will fall into one of two categories:

1. A fix

In this case, structure your commit like below:

```
fix: <description of the fix>

<More detailed explanation of the commit>

Changelog: <None|Title|Commit|All>
Ticket: <None|Ticket Nr>
```



* A new feature

```
feat: <description of the new feature>

<More detailed explanation of the commit>

Changelog: <None|Title|Commit|All>
Ticket: <None|Ticket Nr>
```

### Use of AI/LLMs in contributions

We allow the use of AI in source code and documentation contributions, subject
to the following rules:

- You must review, understand, and, if necessary, correct the source code
  output when using an LLM. We don’t want submissions purely generated
  and submitted by automated AI systems without any human ensuring that
  it is correct and valid. And we don’t want to put this review burden
  solely on our reviewers.
- We have the same expectation of quality for source code whether AI was
  used or not (including security, readability, maintainability,
  correctness, commit history, etc.).
- When AI is used as part of writing / editing some code, we consider
  the person using the AI as a tool, fact-checking / editing its output
  and ultimately submitting the code as a pull request to be the author.
- When using AI, your use must be in compliance with applicable laws and
  terms, such as the EU AI Act, as well as the terms of service and acceptable
  use policy of your AI provider.
- We may change these rules in the future as AI tools and regulation develop.

## Contributor Code of Conduct

We have a [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/mendersoftware/mender/blob/master/code-of-conduct.md) that applies to all contributors and participants to the Mender project.


## Let us work together with you

In an ever more digitized world, securing the world's connected devices is a
very important and meaningful task. To succeed, we will need to row in the same
direction and work to the best interest of the project.

This project appreciates your friendliness, transparency and a collaborative
spirit.
