Contributing to Mender
============================

We are thrilled to see you at this page!

Thanks for showing interest in contributing to the Mender project. We hope you will find what you need to get started on this page.

## Reporting security issues

If you come across any security issue, please bring it to the right people's attention as quickly as possible by sending an email to 
[security@mender.io](mailto:security@mender.io).

Please do not disclose anything in public. Once an issue has been addressed we will publish the fix and acknowledge your finding on our site if you so wish.


## Reporting issues / bugs
The best way to report an issue is to report this to [our issue tracker](https://tracker.mender.io/projects/MEN?target=_blank).

Before submitting an issue, please make a quick search to see if the issues already has been identified or not. Duplicates will not make the issue go away any faster :-)

As with everything in life, the more details and quality you put into explaining the issue, including making it as easy as possible to reproduce (if it is a bug), the better.

## Providing pull requests
Yes, please! Pull requests are welcome, and the maintainers of Mender work hard to stay on top to review and hopefully merge your work.

If your work is significant, please make sure to create [an issue in the tracker](https://tracker.mender.io/projects/MEN?target=_blank). Also, before commencing such work, it can make sense to discuss the idea with the maintainers and relevant project members upfront.


### Sign your work
Mender is licensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0. To ensure open source license compatibility, we need to keep track of the origin of all commits and make sure they comply with the license. To do this, we follow the same procedure as used by the Linux kernel, and ask every commit to be signed off.

The sign-off is a simple line at the end of the explanation for the
patch, which certifies that you wrote it or otherwise have the right to
pass it on as an open-source commit.  The rules are pretty simple: if you
can certify the below (from [developercertificate.org](http://developercertificate.org/)):


```
Developer Certificate of Origin
Version 1.1

Copyright (C) 2004, 2006 The Linux Foundation and its contributors.
660 York Street, Suite 102,
San Francisco, CA 94110 USA

Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this
license document, but changing it is not allowed.

Developer's Certificate of Origin 1.1

By making a contribution to this project, I certify that:

(a) The contribution was created in whole or in part by me and I
    have the right to submit it under the open source license
    indicated in the file; or

(b) The contribution is based upon previous work that, to the best
    of my knowledge, is covered under an appropriate open source
    license and I have the right under that license to submit that
    work with modifications, whether created in whole or in part
    by me, under the same open source license (unless I am
    permitted to submit under a different license), as indicated
    in the file; or

(c) The contribution was provided directly to me by some other
    person who certified (a), (b) or (c) and I have not modified
    it.

(d) I understand and agree that this project and the contribution
    are public and that a record of the contribution (including all
    personal information I submit with it, including my sign-off) is
    maintained indefinitely and may be redistributed consistent with

```

Then you just add a line to every git commit message:

    Signed-off-by: Random J Developer <random@developer.example.org>

Use your real name (sorry, no pseudonyms or anonymous contributions.)

If you set your `user.name` and `user.email` git configs, you can sign your
commit automatically with `git commit -s`.

## Let's stay happy!
In an ever more digitized world, securing the world's connected devices is a very important and meaningful task. To succeed, we will need to row in the same direction and work to the best interest of the project. 

This project appreciates your friendliness, transparency and a collaborative spirit.
