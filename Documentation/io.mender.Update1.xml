      SetUpdateControlMap:
      @update_control_map: JSON update control map (see description for schema)
      @refresh_timeout: Seconds until the request should be refreshed.

      `update_control_map` determines the update control flow, allowing the
      user to interrupt the update process at specified states. The parameter
      takes the following JSON schema:
      ```json
      {
        "id": "da32f669-e82c-455e-848b-606e0110f0a0",
        "priority": 0,
        "states": {
          "ArtifactInstall_Enter": {
            "action": "continue|force_continue|pause|fail",
            "on_map_expire": "continue|force_continue|fail",
            "on_action_executed": "continue|force_continue|pause|fail"
          },
          "ArtifactReboot_Enter": { ... },
          "ArtifactCommit_Enter": { ... }
        }
      }
      ```

        * `id` is a unique ID for the update control map. In the special case
          where the `id` is equal to the deployment ID, the update_control_map
          is cleared after the deployment finished. This happens if the
          update_control_map is provisioned with the deployment.
        * `states` instructs the Mender client what to do when entering
          the state given as object key. Valid `state` values include: `ArtifactInstall_Enter`,
          `ArtifactReboot_Enter` and `ArtifactCommit_Enter`.
          * `action` is the action
             executed for the given state, `continue` and `force_continue` proceeds
             with the update, `pause` will wait before proceeding and `fail` will fail
             the deployment immediately - defaults to `continue`.
          * `on_map_expire` is the action taken when the application does not refresh
            the update_control_map in time - the default value depends on `action`:
            continue=continue, force_continue=force_continue, pause/fail=fail.
          * `on_action_executed` is the next action which will be executed after the
            current one has executed. This provides an atomic way for an update to,
            for example, continue, and then immediately go back to pausing all
            subsequent updates. This is useful if each update must be approved by a
            user on the device. Defaults to the value in `action`.
        * `priority` is used for resolving conflicting update control maps for the same
          deployment. If multiple maps exist for the same priority, the order of
          precedence is `fail`, `pause`, `force_continue`. `continue` is only
          executed if no other action exists at any priority level.
