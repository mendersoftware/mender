## Why Mender?

Mender enables secure and robust over-the-air updates for all device software. Some of the core
functionalities include:

* üíª Flexible management server and client architecture for secure OTA software update deployments
  and fleet management.
* üíæ Standalone deployment support, triggered at the device-level (**no server needed**) for
  unconnected or USB delivered software updates.
* üîÑ Automatic rollback upon update failure with an A/B partition design.
* üîÄ Support for a full root file system, application, files, and containerized updates.
* ‚úÖ Dynamic grouping, phased rollouts to ensure update success.
* ‚öôÔ∏è Advanced configuration, monitoring, and troubleshooting for software updates.
* üî¨ Extensive logging, audits, reporting, and security and regulatory compliance capabilities.

### Our mission and goals

Embedded product teams often create homegrown updaters at the last minute due to the need to fix
bugs in field-deployed devices. However, the essential requirement for an embedded update process is
*robustness*. For example, loss of power at any time should not brick a device. This creates a
challenge, given the time constraints to develop and maintain a homegrown updater.

**Mender aims to address this challenge with a *robust* and *easy to use* updater for embedded Linux
devices, which is open source and available to anyone.**

Robustness is ensured with *atomic* image-based deployments using a dual A/B rootfs partition
layout. This makes it always possible to roll back to a working state, even when losing power at any
time during the update process.

Ease of use is addressed with an intuitive UI, [comprehensive
documentation](https://docs.mender.io/), a [meta layer for the Yocto
Project](https://github.com/mendersoftware/meta-mender) for *easy integration into existing
environments*, and high-quality software (see the test coverage badge).

## Where to start?

| **Mender enterprise**| **Mender Open Source** |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| Ready to get started on an enterprise-grade OTA software update solution? Capabilities include advanced fleet management, security, and compliance: role-based access control (RBAC), dynamic groups, delta updates, and mutual TLS support. Get started with [hosted Mender](https://hosted.mender.io/ui/signup) and evaluate Mender for free. | Alternatively, the Mender open-source option allows you to start doing smart device updates in a quick, secure, and robust method. Check out [how to get started](https://docs.mender.io/get-started). <br /> In order to support rollback, the Mender client depends on integration with the boot loader and the partition layout. It is, therefore, most easily built as part of your Yocto Project image by using the [meta layer for the Yocto Project](https://github.com/mendersoftware/meta-mender). |

If you want to compare the options available, look at our
[features](https://mender.io/product/features) page.

# High-level architecture overview

![Mender architecture](mender_architecture.png)
<!-- https://drive.google.com/file/d/1pKfJ-eRHYrDYZW7jCTHI7_D9tEF-rKDz -->

The chart above depicts a typical Mender architecture with the following elements:

* Back End & User Interface: The shaded sky blue area is the Mender product which comprises the back end and the user interface (UI).
* Clients: The Mender client runs on the devices represented by the devices icon.
* Gateway: All communications between devices, users, and the back end occur through an API gateway. [Traefik](https://traefik.io) is used for the API gateway. The gateway routes the requests coming from the clients to the right micro-service(s) in the Mender back end.
* NATS message broker: some of the micro-services use NATS as a message broker to support the Mender device update troubleshooting and the orchestration within the system.
* Mongo DB: persistent database for the Mender back end micro-services.
* Storage layer: in both hosted and on-premise Mender, an AWS S3 Bucket (or S3 API-compatible) or an Azure Storage Account storage layer is used to store the artifacts.
* Redis: in-memory cache to enable device management at scale.

You can find more detailed information in our [documentation](https://docs.mender.io/3.5/server-installation/overview).

# About this repository

This repository contains the Mender client updater, which can be run in standalone mode (manually
triggered through its command line interface) or managed mode (connected to the Mender server).

Mender provides both the client-side updater and the backend and UI for managing deployments as open
source. The Mender server is designed as a microservices architecture and comprises several
repositories.

## Installing from source

### Requirements

* C compiler
* [Go compiler](https://golang.org/dl/)
* liblzma-dev, libssl-dev and libglib2.0-dev packages

#### LZMA support opt-out

If no LZMA Artifact compression support is desired, you can ignore the `liblzma-dev` package
dependency and substitute the `make` commands in the instructions below for:

```
make TAGS=nolzma
```

#### D-Bus support opt-out

If no D-Bus support is desired, you can ignore the `libglib2.0-dev` package dependency and
substitute the `make` commands in the instructions below for:

```
make TAGS=nodbus
```

### Steps

To install Mender on a device from source, first clone the repository in the correct folder
structure inside your `$GOPATH` (typically `$HOME/go`):

```
git clone https://github.com/mendersoftware/mender.git $GOPATH/src/github.com/mendersoftware/mender
```

Then run the following commands inside the cloned repository:

```
make
sudo make install
```

### Installation notes

Installing this way does not offer a complete system updater.  For this, you need additional
integration steps. Depending on which OS you are using, consult one of the following:

* [System updates: Debian family](https://docs.mender.io/system-updates-debian-family)
* [System updates: Yocto Project](https://docs.mender.io/system-updates-yocto-project)

However, it is possible to use [Update Modules](https://docs.mender.io/artifacts/update-modules)
and update other parts of the system.

In order to connect to a Mender server, you either need to get a [Mender
Professional](https://hosted.mender.io/) account, or [set up a server
environment](https://docs.mender.io/getting-started/create-a-test-environment). If
you are setting up a demo environment, you will need to put the
`support/demo.crt` file into `/etc/mender/server.crt` on the device and add the
configuration line below to `/etc/mender/mender.conf` after the installation
steps above:

```
  "ServerCertificate": "/etc/mender/server.crt"
```

Keep in mind that `/etc/mender/mender.conf` will be overwritten if you rerun the
`sudo make install` command.

**Important:** `demo.crt` is not a secure certificate and should only be used for demo purposes,
never in production.

## Cross-compiling

### Requirements

* C cross-compiler for the target platform
* [Go compiler](https://golang.org/dl/)

### Build steps

#### Cross-compiler setup

Download the cross-compiler required for your device. Then add the cross-compiler `bin/`
subfolder in your path and set the `CC` variable accordingly using the commands:

```
export PATH=$PATH:<path_to_my_cross_compiler>/bin
export CC=<cross_compiler_prefix>
```

For instance, to cross-compiling for Raspberry Pi:

```
git clone https://github.com/raspberrypi/tools.git
export PATH="$PATH:$(pwd)/tools/arm-bcm2708/gcc-linaro-arm-linux-gnueabihf-raspbian-x64/bin"
export CC=arm-linux-gnueabihf-gcc
```

#### libssl dependency

Download, extract, compile, and install libssl with the following commands:

```
wget -q https://www.openssl.org/source/openssl-1.1.1k.tar.gz
tar -xzf openssl-1.1.1k.tar.gz
cd openssl-1.1.1k
./Configure <target-arch> --prefix=$(pwd)/install
make
make install
```

Where `target-arch` should be one of the available targets specified by OpenSSL ( Run `./Configure`
for help ), for example, `linux-armv4`

Export an environment variable for later use:

```
export LIBSSL_INSTALL_PATH=$(pwd)/install
```

#### liblzma dependency

Download, extract, compile, and install liblzma with the following commands:

```
wget -q https://tukaani.org/xz/xz-5.2.4.tar.gz
tar -xzf xz-5.2.4.tar.gz
cd xz-5.2.4
./configure --host=<target-arch> --prefix=$(pwd)/install
make
make install
```

Where `target-arch` should match your device toolchain, for example, `arm-linux-gnueabihf`

Export an environment variable for later use:

```
export LIBLZMA_INSTALL_PATH=$(pwd)/install
```

### Build steps

Now, to cross-compile Mender, run the following commands inside the cloned repository:

```
make CGO_CFLAGS="-I${LIBLZMA_INSTALL_PATH}/include -I${LIBSSL_INSTALL_PATH}/include" CGO_LDFLAGS="-L${LIBLZMA_INSTALL_PATH}/lib -L${LIBSSL_INSTALL_PATH}/lib" \
CGO_ENABLED=1 GOOS=linux GOARCH=<arch>
```

Where `arch` is the target architecture (for example, `arm`). See all possible values for `GOARCH`
in the [source code](https://github.com/golang/go/blob/master/src/go/build/syslist.go). Also, note
that for `arm` architecture, you also need to specify which family to compile for with `GOARM`; for
more information, see [this link](https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/GoArm)

You can deploy the mender client file tree in a custom directory in order to send it to your device
afterward. To deploy all mender client files in a custom directory, run the command:

```
make prefix=<custom-dir> install
```

Where `custom-dir` is the destination folder for your file tree

Finally, copy this file tree into your target's device rootfs. You can do it remotely
using SSH, for example.
