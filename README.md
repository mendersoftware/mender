## Our mission
We want to help organizations make their internet connected products more secure by offering a series of inexpensive, open and ease to use software solutions. We shall be easy to deal with and approach everyone we deal with in an open and transparent manner. Customers don’t choose us because we deliver the most bleeding-edge solution, but because the combination of  open and easy to use greatly reduces the risks and aversion against making changes to their products.


## Our promise
“Our promise is to offer superior customer support and ***easy to use*** software applications that individually and collectively will make your connected products 
more secure against data breaches”


## Target audience
Mender is a general purpose solution aimed at embedded system developers across any industry.


##Current status
Mender is in rapid development. Currently, we have a working Mender client and Yocto meta-mender layer. This allows you to build a [Yocto image](https://www.yoctoproject.org?target=_blank) with Mender for Beaglebone and QEMU, and conduct a full local image update. If booting of the new image fails, Mender will automatically roll-back to the previous working image. Soon, we will release a server backend that allows you to conduct a basic end-to-end image based update.
